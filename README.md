# PitchPerfectProgrammatically
Project for Udacity course "Intro to iOS App Development with Swift"

An iPhone app that records audio, and then gives 6 audio playback options, such as sounding like a chipmunk or Darth Vader.

While the original project used storyboard, this version was made completely programmatically.
